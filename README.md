A reflex trainer web app for mastering numbers in foreign languages. Train your brain to understand and speak numbers
instantly, not just translate them.

## Overview

Number trainer helps you build reflexes for numbers in foreign languages. Instead of mentally translating "오십사" →
"fifty-four" → 54, you'll learn to instantly recognize 오십사 as 54.

The app uses spaced repetition (FSRS algorithm) to optimize your learning, with two practice modes:

- **Listen mode**: Hear a number, type the digits
- **Speak mode**: See a number, say it aloud

Currently supports **Sino-Korean** numbers. The architecture supports adding more languages.
